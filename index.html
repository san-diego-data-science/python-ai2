      </h4>
      <p class="text-base text-gray-800"><span class="font-semibold">Python + AI<sup>2</sup></span> (pronounced "Python plus AI squared") is a summer coding camp designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of programming using Python. Python is widely recognized as the best starting language for learning programming due to its readability, simplicity, and versatility in both education and industry. It is also the primary language of the AI community, making it the ideal foundation for exploring artificial intelligence concepts.</p>
      <p class="text-base text-gray-800 mt-2">The camp explores AI in two ways: first, by leveraging an AI coding assistant to help students understand, write, and document their Python code; and second, by integrating an external AI service to create an AI-powered opponent for a game project.</p>
      <p class="text-base text-gray-800 mt-2">The main application will be a popular text-based game. Students will first implement the game in Python for player-vs-player mode, and then extend it to include an AI-powered opponent.</p>
      <p class="text-base text-blue-900 mt-6 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg px-4 py-3 shadow font-medium">
        <span class="text-blue-700">This program was conceived and developed by <span class="font-bold">Andrea Zonca</span> in 2025. The curriculum is deeply integrated with the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, including direct interaction with bleeding-edge Large Language Models (like ChatGPT). Instruction will be provided personally by Dr. Zonca, ensuring a high-quality and engaging learning experience for all participants.</span>

        The world of programming is evolving rapidly, and thanks to the support of AI, a hands-on, practical approach to learning is more effective and accessible than ever before. At this camp, we believe the best way to learn is by doing: experimenting, exploring, and learning from mistakes. Rather than focusing on abstract theory, we encourage students to dive in, get their hands dirty, and build real projects. This active, experience-driven method—now enhanced by AI tools—not only builds confidence and problem-solving skills, but also fosters curiosity and a genuine love for coding.
